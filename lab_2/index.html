        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project provides an overview of the process of developing a network and security plan for a small office environment. The focus is on building a basic network diagram, implementing security protocols, and establishing an incident response plan.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In todayâ€™s digital age, small businesses are increasingly dependent on technology for their daily operations. . Many small offices lack dedicated IT support, which makes it critical to establish clear and effective network and security documentation. This project provides a structured approach to managing the basic office network and securing the environment. By creating a simple network diagram, establishing basic security protocols, and developing an incident response plan, this documentation will empower the small office staff to better understand and manage their own IT environment.</p>


        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The small office in this project consists of four employees, but they might hire another person down the road as they grow. They would like a shared network for their internet services, file sharing, and one office printer. So far, they have not had any incidents. Since they believe they will grow in the next few years, they wanted something manageable but could also frow. The project s intended to address these gaps by providing easy-to-follow documentation that any employee, regardless of technical background, can understand and implement. However, at this time the office manager Sam will be responsible. It should be noted that Sam is also an IT student. This documentation is designed to reduce the complexity of network management and introduce a policy to follow if there is an incident.

        <h2>Network Diagram Creation</h2>
        <p>The first step in this project was to create a network diagram to map out all devices and connections within the office. The diagram was created using Lucidchart which is an online diagramming tool. Lucidchart. Allowed for easy visualization of the physical and logical structure of the network. (LucidChart) The objective was to make the diagram simple enough for non-technical staff to understand it while still providing enough detail for Sam to manage their network.

        <h2>Key Components of the Network Diagram:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Workstations for four employees (John, Roberto, Mary, and Sam)</li>
            <li>Network Printer for shared office printing</li>
            <li>Wireless Access Point for wireless connectivity</li>
            <li>Managed Switch for network segmentation</li>
            <li>Small Web Server managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting resources</li>
            <li>Router to connect the office network to the internet</li>
            <li>Simple Server with local storage synced to AWS incremental backup</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These components are sufficient to get the small office operational. The diagram clearly identifies each component and its use on the network. This provides a clear understanding of the physical and logical structure.</p>

        <h2>Security Protocol Development</h2>
        <p>After the network diagram was completed, the next step was to develop basic security protocols to protect the network. These security protocols include password management guidelines, device access policies, and rules for sharing resources. The primary focus was on keeping the security measures straightforward and manageable for a small office without a dedicated IT department.</p>

        <h2>Security Measures Include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Regular Password Changes:</strong> Enforcing a 60-day password change policy through Active Directory using open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
             <a href="https://youtu.be/GRy5GFuZfWw?si=imBFHckv8O4O7hK2" target="_blank">How to configure a password policy in AD</a>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Windows Defender:</strong> Use Group Policy settings to configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/use-group-policy-microsoft-defender-antivirus" target="_blank">Microsoft Defender setup guide</a>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Active Directory and SCCM: Implementing a simple Active Directory (AD) with System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) for centralized managment.</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuFM6_kyQVY" target="blank" >Installing Active Directory and Creating Domain</a>
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Using a managed switch to segment the network and limit lateral movement in case of a breach. This set up is discussed under Network Security Implementation</li>
            <li> <strong>Backup Strategy</strong> Performing a small incremental backup every Saturday night, with backups saved for redundancy using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for a small monthly fee. This is also done locally on Simple Server. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-policy/group-policy-backup-restore" target="blank" >Backup, restore, migrate, and copy Group Policy Objects</a></li>
            <l> <strong>Restrict Access:</strong>  Limiting access to certain parts of the network and avoiding the use of shared credentials.</l>
            <li> <strong>Wireless Security:</strong> Configured WPA3 and hidden SSID to protect network access. 
    <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/wep-vs-wpa-vs-wpa2-vs-wpa3/" target="_blank">WPA3 explained</a></li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
        <p>An Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) was also developed to provide clear guidelines modeled after FR Secure Acceptable Use Policy Template (FRSecure. 2024). This describes how the office network and devices should be used. The policy for this small office is customized specifically for this environment and includes the following points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authorized Use Only:</strong> The office network and devices are t be used for business purposes only. Personal activities, such as streaming entertainment or accessing social media unrelated to work, are prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>No Unauthorized Devices:</strong> Employees are not allowed to connect any personal devices (BYOD- Bring Your Own Device) to the work network without explicit authorization. This policy helps prevent unauthorized access and minimizes security risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Employees must not share sensitive business information without proper authorization. Information, when allowed, should only be shared through secure channels.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Use:</strong> Access to unauthorized or potentially harmful websites is prohibited. Employees are expected to use the internet in a way that is appropriate and maintains the integrity of the office network.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>All employes were required to review and acknowledge the AUP. This will help maintain a secure work environment by ensuring that everyone understands their responsibilities regarding network use</p>
        <h2>Network Security Implementation</h2>
        <p>When implementing the network security industry best practices were followed to secure the small office environment. The main goals were to strike a balance between secure and manageable by non-technical staff.</p>
        <h2>Steps Taken Include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Router Security</strong> Secured the router with strong administrative credentials and configured to auto-update the firmware. Set Up DHCP. <a href="https://kb.netgear.com/21934/How-do-I-configure-a-Dynamic-Host-Configuration-Protocol-DHCP-reservation-using-the-web-interface-on-my-managed-switch" >Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.</a> This will help have scalability in place for future growth.</li>
            <li> <strong>Firewall Configuration:</strong> Configured Firewall using Windows Firewall Rules (Matarazzo, P. & Pamnani, V. 2024) <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/rules" >Windows Firewall Rules</a></li>
            <li><strong>Network Segmentation</strong> Used a managed switch to segment the network. Each port was configured to a specific device. This kept the server separate and would limit lateral movement in case of a breach</li>
            <li> <strong>Switch Model: Netgear GS308E</strong> An inexpensive managed switch was selected <a href="https://www.netgear.com/support/product/gs308e/" >GS308E_8 Port GB Ethernet Plus Switch</a></li>
            <li> <strong>Antivirus Protection:</strong> Configured Windows Defender on all workstations with regularly scheduled scans to ensure ongoing protection. *Windows Defender is updated through Windows Security System Updates.</li>
            <li> <strong>Backup Strategy</strong>  Cloud Backups are managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). On-premises backups are stored on the root of C on Simple Server.</li>
            <li> <strong>Note for BU Strategy</strong> Having two backups, one on-prem and the other in the cloud will provide added data protection.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Incident Response Plan:</h2>
        <p>An incident response plan was also created to guide office staff in the event of a security breach or a network issue. This plan was modeled after FRSecure and then customized to mt the needs of this small office. This plan outlines the steps that should be taken if an incident occurs. The plan was kept simple and easy to follow. The goal of the incident response plan is to minimize downtime and reduce data loss.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Step 1: Identify and Document</strong> A.  Identify the nature of the issue (examples may be unauthorized access, malware infection, disaster). B. Document what has been affected.</li>
            <li> <Strong>Step 2: Disconnect Affected Devices</Strong> Disconnect devices from the network to prevent further spread of the issue.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 3: Notify the Appropriate Person</strong> Contact Sam or IT Dept. Provide Documentation</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 4: Assess the Cause</strong> Work with Sam/IT to determine the cause of the incident.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 5: Restore Systems</strong> If necessary, restore systems from Simple Server or Restore systems using AWS.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This basic network and security documentation for a small office is intended to improve the day-to-day functioning of the business. This project documentation has provided a structured approach to managing a small office network. A network diagram was created, security protocols were defined, and an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) was implemented. An incident response plan was drawn up to support employees when disaster hits. This documentation provides the basic tools needed to maintain an office network.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>As I converted my academic paper into a web-based format using HTML, I aimed to maintain the original structure and clarity of the content while using appropriate semantic tags to improve readability and accessibility. I started with the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag to wrap the entire body of the paper, reflecting that it is a standalone piece of content.</p>
         <p>I used the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to include the network diagram and made sure to add an <code>alt</code> attribute for accessibility. For in-text citations and references, I used <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags so users could easily access the original resources via hyperlinks. This not only supports credibility but also makes the webpage more interactive.</p>
         <p> One of the challenges I faced was breaking up large blocks of text into meaningful sections. HTML encouraged me to look at the structure more critically and consider how readers navigate digital content differently than print. I tried to keep the formatting clean and readable, knowing that styling would be handled later with CSS.</p>
         <p>Overall, this project helped me understand the importance of semantic HTML and how using the right tags gives content both structure and meaning. It also prepares the page for future improvements in appearance and accessibility.</p>
